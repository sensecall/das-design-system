## When to use this component

The badge is useful for drawing users attention to particular information. It should be used sparingly because when used a lot it loses its value.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the badge component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

The default, neutral badge is blue. [Alternative styles](/styles/badge) are also available, for example, green and red.

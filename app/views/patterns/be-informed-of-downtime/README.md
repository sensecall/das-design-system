Inform users of upcoming downtime.

<img src="/public/images/patterns/downtime-warning.png" alt="A screenshot of the downtime warning pattern in use. It is placed directly above the H1." />

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you know in advance that your service will be unavailable.

## How it works

The pattern uses the information variant of the [banner pattern](/components/banner/).

The banner should be shown on the first page the user sees after logging in, and then not shown again for that session. If they log in again before the downtime, it would be shown again.

## Research on this pattern

We need more research. If you have used the support, get in touch to share your research findings.

## Contribute to this pattern

You can contribute to this pattern via the [design system backlog](https://github.com/skillsfundingagency/das-design-system/issues/52)

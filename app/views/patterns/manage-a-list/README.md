## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when users need to perform the same action on a list repeatedly, like archiving several messages at a time.

## How it works

The user selects the items they want to action. Then selects one of the action buttons above the list.

The action might take the user down a flow. Or if the action can be performed immediately without further questions, show a [success message](/components/banner/) at the top of the page.

### Select all

You can let users select all items in a list using the [Multi Select](/components/multi-select) Component.

When items are within a table, the select all button should be in the first table heading cell.

## Gaps in the pattern

- being able to manage items one at a time, without multiple selection. Such as buttons and links in each row. Or when to click an item before editing it.
- alternative patterns to tables. Such as a timeline or a list of items shown as cards.

## Research on this pattern
